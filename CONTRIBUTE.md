# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/familytree365/php-gedcom).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-4 Coding Standard.]** The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Create feature branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
- **Run tests before submitting a pull request.** Ensure that all tests pass by running `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/` from the root directory. Add new tests if you introduce new functionality or modify existing logic.
